    "# contemporary Greek historians to have been used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to generals during times of war.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Caesar cipher shifts each letter of a message to another letter in the alphabet located a fixed distance from \n",
    "# the original letter. If our encryption key were 1, we would shift h to the next letter i, i to the next letter j, \n",
    "# and so on. If we reach the end of the alphabet, which for us is the space character, we simply loop back to a. \n",
    "# To decode the message, we make a similar shift, except we move the same number of steps backwards in the alphabet.\n",

    "# Over the next five exercises, we will create our own Caesar cipher, as well as a message decoder for this cipher. \n",
