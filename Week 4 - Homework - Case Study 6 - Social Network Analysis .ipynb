    "Homophily is a property of networks.  Homophily occurs when nodes that are neighbors in a network also share a characteristic more often than nodes that are not network neighbors.  In this case study, we will investigate homophily of several characteristics of individuals connected in social networks in rural India."

    "\n",
    "How much homophily do we expect by chance? If characteristics are distributed completely randomly, the probability that two nodes \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) share characteristic \\(a\\) is the probability both nodes have characteristic \\(a\\) , which is the marginal probability of \\(a\\) squared. The total probability that nodes \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) share their characteristic is therefore the sum of the square of the marginal probabilities of each characteristic in the network.\n",
